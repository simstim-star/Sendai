# Sendai Engine
A game engine based on DirectX12 in pure C. This is a working in progress project that I created for educational purposes, in order to learn better about COM and DirectX.

Also check my ports of the official DirectX12 samples to pure C: https://github.com/simstim-star/DirectX-Graphics-Samples-in-C
And my port of DirectX Match to pure C: https://github.com/simstim-star/DirectXMath-in-C
